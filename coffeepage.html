        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
          Recent advances in quantum caffeination theory have revealed unexpected correlations between entangled coffee
          molecules and workplace productivity metrics. This study demonstrates that QEC particles exhibit non-local
          effects on human consciousness, resulting in a 47.3% improvement in task completion rates. Using a
          double-blind, placebo-controlled methodology with n = 2,847 participants, we observed statistically significant
          (p < 0.001) enhancements in cognitive function following consumption of quantum-entangled espresso. These
          findings suggest potential applications in corporate efficiency optimization and may explain the universe's
          apparent preference for morning meetings.

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The relationship between caffeine consumption and productivity has been documented since the discovery of
          coffee in 850 CE [1]. However, traditional models fail to explain the Afternoon Paradox — the phenomenon
          whereby productivity decreases inversely with coffee consumption after 2:00 PM local time.

        <blockquote>

        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Recent work by Johnson et al. [2] proposed that coffee molecules might exist in quantum superposition
          states. Building on this foundation, we hypothesized that entangled coffee particles could maintain
          coherence across spatial and temporal boundaries, potentially solving the Afternoon Paradox.

        <h2>2. Methods</h2>

        <h3>2.1 Quantum Coffee Preparation</h3>
        <p>The experimental setup was revised to enhance clarity and safety protocols. The original method:</p>
        <p><del>Grinding beans manually in the presence of a magnetic field.</del></p>
        <p>was replaced with:</p>
        <p><u>Automated grinding under cryogenic stabilization to preserve entanglement integrity.</u></p>

        <p>Coffee beans were subjected to controlled quantum entanglement using the Globocorp QED-3000.
          The process involved:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Pre-treatment with coherent photon bombardment (λ = 632.8 nm)</li>
          <li>Grinding at precisely 77 K to maintain quantum states</li>
          <li>Brewing under 1.21 gigapascals of pressure</li>
          <li>Immediate consumption within the decoherence window (τ < 5 minutes)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>2.2 Experimental Design</h3>
        <p>Participants (n = 2,847) were randomly assigned to three groups:</p>
        <p>Control Group (CG)</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Regular coffee prepared using standard methods</p>
        <p>Quantum Group (QG)</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Quantum-entangled coffee with verified entanglement coefficients</p>
        <p>Placebo Group (PG)</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Decaffeinated coffee with simulated quantum properties</p>
